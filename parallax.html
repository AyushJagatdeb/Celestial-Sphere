            <p><span class="first-character ny">M</span>ercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, is also the closest one to the Sun. Its surface is covered in craters and scarps due to its lack of atmosphere and geological activity. Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest as its lack of atmosphere causes extreme temperature changes between day and night. A day on Mercury is longer than its year, making it the slowest rotating planet in our solar system. It is named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, due to its quick movement across the sky as observed from Earth.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">Mercury is also known for its odd behavior, as it has been observed to have a tiny amount of liquid water ice in its polar regions, even though its surface temperature can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists believe this ice may have been delivered by comets or asteroids, making Mercury a fascinating subject for future exploration.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character ny">V</span>enus, often called Earth's "sister planet," is the hottest planet in the solar system with a surface temperature that can reach up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit. It rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, which means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide creates a runaway greenhouse effect that traps heat, making its surface hot enough to melt lead. Venus is also home to the longest lava flow in the solar system, spanning over 6,000 miles. .</p>

            <p class="margin-top-10">Despite being the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus is still a mystery to scientists as they have yet to fully understand its geological and atmospheric conditions. Due to its similarities to Earth, there is ongoing interest in studying Venus to better understand how planets evolve over time and how our own planet may change in the future.</p>

It is the fourth planet from the sun and is known for its distinct reddish hue. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and is often referred to as the "little brother" of Earth. It is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands at a height of over 22 kilometers.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">Scientists believe that Mars once had oceans and a much thicker atmosphere, making it a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life. With numerous rovers and spacecraft already exploring the planet, and with plans for future human missions, the secrets of Mars are slowly but surely being unlocked, offering a glimpse into the mysteries of our neighboring planet.</p>

Made up of ice particles, rock, and dust, the rings are the most extensive in our solar system and can be seen from Earth with a telescope. The planet's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases. Saturn has over 80 moons, with the largest being Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and is the only known moon in our solar system with lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane.</p>

            <p class="margin-top-10">The Cassini spacecraft, which studied Saturn and its moons for 13 years before ending its mission in 2017, made several groundbreaking discoveries, including the discovery of water vapor on one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus. Saturn also has several intriguing weather patterns, including a hexagonal-shaped polar vortex at its north pole. With its stunning rings and diverse moons, Saturn is a fascinating planet that continues to captivate astronomers and space enthusiasts.</p>

Unlike the other planets in our solar system, Uranus is tilted almost 98 degrees, which means it essentially orbits the sun on its side. Uranus has a unique system of faint rings made up of tiny particles and eleven known inner moons, five major moons, and an additional twenty-seven small moons. </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">The largest moon of Uranus, Titania, is the eighth largest moon in the solar system. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, and its name comes from the Greek god of the sky. Despite its many interesting features, Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by in 1986.</p>

It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter almost four times that of Earth. One interesting fact about Neptune is that it has the strongest winds in the solar system, with gusts reaching up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. It also has a unique system of faint rings and fourteen known moons, including Triton, the only large moon in the solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet's rotation.</p>

            <p class="margin-top-10">Neptune was first observed by Galileo in 1612 but was not recognized as a planet until 1846 when mathematical predictions led to its discovery. Its blue color comes from the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Despite its interesting features, Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by in 1989.</p>
